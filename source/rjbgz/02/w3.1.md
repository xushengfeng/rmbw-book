Many people agree that our lives have been changed by the Internet, but I have recently realised that I live nearly my entire life online!
In the morning, I wake up and immediately check my messages. I usually have messages from friends or family, and I always reply right away. Then I open my favourite online radio station and listen to music while I get ready for school.
While I’m eating breakfast, I often read news articles online. Sometimes I read news out loud for my mum while she cooks breakfast. She doesn’t have much time to read, so she enjoys hearing me read aloud to her.
On my way to school, I usually wear my earphones so I can listen to an English podcast with interesting talks about many different topics. It’s a good way to improve my English listening, especially on days when English is the first lesson.
At lunch, I like to check some online forums about topics I’m interested in, such as pop music and TV shows. I read the updated posts from other forum members and post my own thoughts when I think they will be helpful to other people. I think it’s a good way to connect with others who share the same interests as me.
On the way home from school, I almost always play with one of the many learning apps on my phone. I have an app that helps me practise maths, an app to practise English grammar, and another one to help me memorise new vocabulary. It’s a fun way to keep on learning even after all my classes are over.
After dinner, I start my homework, and that often means going online to do research. My history teacher, my Chinese literature teacher, and my English teacher all often give homework assignments that require me to go online and look up information. So I’m nearly always online in the evening, reading online resources for my homework.
If I finish my homework before 9:00 p.m., my parents will let me play half an hour of video games, which are almost always online games! I like online games because I can play with my friends even when we’re not in the same place.
My final thing to do every day is to listen to an audio book online before I go to sleep! Sometimes I like to read an online book, but I don’t like to look at a screen just before bedtime, so audio books are the perfect thing for me. It’s a great way to drift off to sleep.

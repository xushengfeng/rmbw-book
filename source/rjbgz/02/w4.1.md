Hi Mum and Dad!
Well, here we are in Cairo at last. We managed to find a cheap hostel just a stone’s throw away from the famous River Nile. The Egyptian Museum is nearby, too. We saw lots of ancient mummies and also Tutankhamun’s mask-made of pure gold!We took a tour to the Pyramids yesterday. They let us ride up to the pyramids on camels—it felt just like a movie! This morning, we explored an old market area. It was very atmospheric and filled with lots of interesting things. I bought a beautiful necklace for you, Mum—it looks just like one that Queen Cleopatra would have worn! Anyway, we’re going out to eat some more of Egypt’s national dish now. It’s made with rice, so you’d really like it, Dad! Visiting Cairo has been an unforgettable experience, even with the terrible heat! See ya!
Love, Cleo

Hi from Athens, John! There is just so much ancient history to explore here. My first stop was the Acropolis. What a place—I never realised the columns would be so big! The old quarter of Plaka is just like a painting—little streets of houses on hills, all painted white and blue. I go there every night and find a little restaurant to try some traditional Greek food. After my meal, I always order a lovely Greek coffee and just soak up the atmosphere. Tomorrow, I’m going to see the changing of the guard. I can’t wait to take a selfie with them—and their funny shoes! Take care!

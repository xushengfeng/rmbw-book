## Benevolence
Look at others with love, compassion, and kindness, so as to stay in harmony with all people.
亲亲而仁民,仁民而爱物。—孟子
Mencius: Men of virtue love and care for their loved ones, they are therefore kind to other people. When they are kind to people, they treasure everything on earth.
## Righteousness
Always act according to what you know is right, so as to preserve your own integrity.
子曰:君子喻于义,小人喻于利。
The Master said, “A gentleman takes as much trouble to discover what is right as lesser men take to discover what will pay.”
## Propriety
Always behave respectfully towards others.
子曰:非礼勿视,非礼勿听,非礼勿言,非礼勿动。
The Master said, “To look at nothing in defiance of ritual, to listen to nothing in defiance of ritual, to speak of nothing in defiance of ritual, and never to stir hand or foot in defiance of ritual.”
## Wisdom
Learn as much as possible so that you can judge what is right from what is wrong, and what is good from what is evil.
子曰:我非生而知之者,好古,敏以求之者也。
The Master said, “I for my part am not one of those who have innate knowledge. I am simply one who loves the past and who is diligent in investigating it.”
## Fidelity
Be true to yourself: be sure that what you do is true to what you say, and what you say is true to what you think.
子曰:人而无信,不知其可也。
The Master said, “I do not see what use a man can be put to, whose word cannot be trusted.”

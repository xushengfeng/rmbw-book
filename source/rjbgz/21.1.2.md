(Adapted from Canyons of the Colorado by John Wesley Powell)
The Grand Canyon of the Colorado is a canyon composed of many canyons. It is a complex mix of thousands, of tens of thousands, of gorges. In a similar manner, each wall of the canyon is a wall composed of many walls. Every one of these gorges is a world of beauty in itself. Yet all these canyons unite to form one grand canyon, the most gorgeous spectacle on earth.
The carving of the Grand Canyon is the work of rains and rivers. When a shower comes in this land, the streams carve canyons-but a little at each storm; and though storms are far apart and the heavens above are cloudless for most of the days of the year, still, years are plenty in the ages, and an occasional stream called to life by a shower can do much work in centuries of centuries.
In winter some of the characteristics of the Grand Canyon are emphasised. The black rocks below, the varied quartzite , and the green sandstone form the foundation for the enormous red wall. The banded sand stone is crowned by the tower limestone. In winter this is covered with snow. Seen from below, these changing elements seem to graduate into the heavens, and no plane of separation between wall and blue sky can be seen. The heavens make up a part of the wall and form a vast dome from wall to wall, spanning the Grand Canyon with heavenly blue so that the earth and the heavens are blended in one vast structure.
When the clouds play in the canyon, as they often do in the rainy season, another set of effects is produced. Clouds creep out of canyons and wind into other canyons. The heavens seem to be alive, not moving as the heavens move over a plain, in one direction with the wind, but following the multiplied courses of these gorges. In this manner the little clouds seem to be individualised, to have wills and souls of their own, and to be going on diverse jobs--a vast assembly of self-willed clouds, faring here and there, intent upon purposes hidden in their own breasts. In the imagination the clouds belong to the sky, and when they are in the canyon the skies come down into the gorges and cling to the cliffs and lift them up to vast heights, for the sky must still be far away. Thus they lend infinity to the walls.
The wonders of the Grand Canyon cannot be adequately represented by speech itself. The huge forms which result from the sculpture of storms through ages are formed into endless details. Besides the elements of form, there are elements of colour, for here the colours of the heavens are rivalled by the colours of the rocks. But form and colour are not all of the divine qualities of the Grand Canyon. It is the land of music. The river thunders in constant roar, swelling in floods of music when the storms play upon the rocks and fading away in soft whispers when the infinite blue of heaven is unveiled. With the melody of the great tide rising and falling, swelling and vanishing forever, other melodies are heard in the gorges of the side canyons, while the waters plunge in the rapids among the rocks or leap in great waterfalls. Thus the Grand Canyon is a land of song. Altogether it is a symphony of melodies.
The beauties of form, colour, and sound unite in the Grand Canyon--forms unrivalled even by the mountains, colours that contend with sunsets, and sounds that span the musical scale from storm to raindrop, from waterfall to bubbling fountain. Its colours, though many and complex at any instant, change with the rising and setting sun; lights and shadows appear and vanish with the passing clouds, and the changing seasons mark their passage in changing colours. You cannot see the Grand Canyon in one view, as if it were a changeless spectacle from which a curtain might be lifted, but to see it you have to strive from month to month through its gorges. It is a region more difficult to pass through than the Alps or the Himalayas. However, if you have enough strength and courage, after a year of work you will gain an understanding of the Grand Canyon's magnificence, which can only be compared to the magnificence of paradise.

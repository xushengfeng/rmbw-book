MR. FRITH: I like television very much.
           How much does it cost?
ASSISTANT: It's the most expensive model in the shop.
           It costs five hundred pounds.
MR. FRITH: That's too expensive for us.
           We can't afford all that money.
ASSISTANT: This model's less expensive than that one.
           It's only three hundred pounds. But, of course,
           it's not as good as the expensive one.
MR. FRITH: I don't like the model.
           The other model's more expensive, but it's worth the money.
MR. FRITH: Can we buy it on instalments?
ASSISTANT: Of course.
           You can pay a deposit of thirty pounds, and then fourteen pounds a month for three years.
MR. FRITH: Do you like it, dear?
MRS. FRITH:I certainly do,
           but I don't like the price.
           You always want the best,
           but we can't afford it.
           Sometimes you think you're a millionaire!
MR. FRITH: Millionaires don't buy things on instalments!

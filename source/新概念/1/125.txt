SUSAN: Can't you come in and have tea now, Peter?
PETER: Not yet.
       I must water the garden first.
SUSAN: Do you have to water it now?
PETER: I'm afraid I must.
       Look at it!
       It's terribly dry.
SUSAN: What a nuisance!
PETER: Last summer it was very dry, too.
       Don't you remember?
       I had to water it every day.
SUSAN: Well, I'll have tea by myself.
SUSAN: That was quick!
       Have you finished already?
PETER: Yes.
       Look out of the window.
SUSAN: It's raining!
       That means You don't need to water the garden.
PERTR: That was a pleasant surprise.
       It means I can have tea, instead.

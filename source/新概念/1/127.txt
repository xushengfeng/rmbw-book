## Lesson 127
A famous actress

KATE: Can you recognize that woman,
      Liz?
LIZ:  I think I can, Kate.
      It must be Karen Marsh,
      the actress.
KATE: I though so.
      Who's that beside her?
LIZ:  That must be Conrad Reeves.
KATE: Conrad Reeves, the actor?
      It's can't be.
      Let me have another look.
      I think you're right!
      Isn't he her third husband?
LIZ:  No. He must be her fourth or fifth.
KATE: Doesn't Karen Marsh look old!
LIZ:  She does, doesn't she!
      I read she's twenty-nine,
      but she must be at least forty.
KATE: I'm sure she is.
LIZ:  She was a famous actress When I was still at school.
KATE: That was a long time ago,
      wasn't it?
LIZ:  Not that long ago!
      I'm not more than twenty-nine myself.

## Lesson 139
Is that you, John?

GRAHAM TURNER: Is that you, John?
JOHN SMITH:    Yes, speaking.
GRAHAM TURNER: Tell Mary we'll be late for dinner this evening.
JOHN SMITH:    I'm afraid I don't understand.
GRAHAM TURNER: Hasn't Mary told you?
               She invited Charlotte and me to dinner this evening. I said I would be at your house at six o'clock, but the boss want me to do some extra work. I'll have to stay at the office. I don't know when I'll finish.
               Oh, and by the way,
               my wife wants to know if Mary needs any help.
JOHN SMITH:    I don't know what you're talking about.
GRAHAM TURNER: That is John Smith,
               isn't it?
JOHN SMITH:    Yes, I'm John Smith.
GRAHAM TURNER: You are John Smith,
               the engineer, aren't you?
JOHN SMITH:    That's right.
GRAHAM TURNER: You work for the Overseas Engineering Company, don't you?
JOHN SMITH:    No, I don't I'm John Smith the telephone engineer and I'm repairing your telephone line.

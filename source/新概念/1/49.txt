## Lesson 49
At the butcher's

BUTCHER:  Do you want any meat today.
          Mrs. Bird?
MRS.BIRD: Yes, please.
BUTCHER:  Do you want beef or lamb?
MRS.BIRD: Beef, please.
BUTCHER:  This lamb's very good.
MRS.BIRD: I like lamb,
          but my husband doesn't.
BUTCHER:  What about some steak?
          This is a nice piece.
MRS.BIRD: Give me that piece, please.
MRS.BIRD: And a pound of mince, too.
BUTCHER:  Do you want a chicken, Mrs. Bird?
          They 're very nice.
MRS.BIRD: No, thank you.
MRS.BIRD: My husband likes steak,
          but he doesn't like chicken.
BUTCHER:  To tell you the truth, Mrs. Bird,
          I don't like chicken either!

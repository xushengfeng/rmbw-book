## Lesson 63
Thank you, doctor.

DOCTOR:         How's Jimmy today?
MRS. WILLIAMAS: Better. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR:         Can I see him please,
                Mrs. Williams?
MRS. WILLIAMAS: Certainly, doctor.
                Come upstairs.
DOCTOR:         You look very well, Jimmy. You are better now, but you mustn't get up yet. You must stay in bed for another two days.
DOCTOR:         The boy mustn't go to school yet, Mr. Williams.
                And he mustn't eat rich food.
MRS. WILLIAMAS: Does he have a temperature, doctor?
DOCTOR:         No, he doesn't.
MRS. WILLIAMAS: Must he stay in bed?
DOCTOR:         Yes.
                He must remain in bed for another two days.
                He can get up for about two hours each day, but you must keep the room warm.
DOCTOR:         Where's Mr. Williams this evening?
MRS. WILLIAMAS: He's in bed, doctor.
                Can you see him please?
                He has a bad cold, too!

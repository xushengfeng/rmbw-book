JANE:    What's Ron Marston like,
         Pauline?
PAULINE: He's awful!
         He telephoned me four times Yesterday, and three times the day before yesterday.
PAULINE: He telephoned the office yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon.
         My boss answered the telephone.
JANE:    What did your boss say to him?
PAULINE: He said, "Pauline is typing typing letters. She can't speak to you now!"
PAULINE: Then I arrived home at six o'clock yesterday evening. He telephoned again.
         But I didn't answer the phone!
JANE:    Did he telephone again last night?
